            The aricle, "The Ethics of Computer-Generated Actors" talks about if it is morally good to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) to replace actors in movies. Producers CGI actors that had an unexpected death or acciendent while in the process of filming a movie. Instead of removing the actor's character from, every scene that they played a part in, procuders CGI the actor so it looks identical to the real person.

           <br>
           People are questioning this process because they are wondering if CGI is going aganist the dead actor's consent. Also people worry about and that deepfakes and falsified videos which murkier realm of fictional products and truth.

             <li>Fans will not be sad with the sudden removal of a charcter</li>

             <li>No barriers to your imagination as a filmmaker</li>
           </ol>

           Harms:
           <ol>
             <li>You could put actors out of work</li>
             <li>There are no limitation so it can be too much</li>

         </td>
         <td width="25%"><font size="+1"><u>For better or for worse?</u></font>
           <br>
           I think that it is for better because it will take a lot of money to take the dead actors out of the movies so CGI is the best way to go.
